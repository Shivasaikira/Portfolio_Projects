## üåç Problem Statement  
Coral reefs are one of the most vital marine ecosystems, supporting biodiversity, tourism, and fisheries while protecting coastal regions from erosion. However, coral reefs face unprecedented threats due to coral bleaching events caused by rising sea temperatures, pollution, and ocean acidification.  

This report aims to provide actionable insights into coral reef bleaching patterns and their drivers to help stakeholders mitigate the risks and safeguard these ecosystems.

## üìù Executive Summary  
Coral reef ecosystems are under threat due to increased oceanic stress, leading to widespread coral bleaching. The dataset of 41,361 rows and 62 columns was analyzed to identify key environmental stressors, regional bleaching patterns, and temporal trends.  

- **2019** recorded the highest bleaching events globally with **35,000 events**, and **114 regions** were significantly impacted.  
- The **Indian Ocean** has the highest risk index, while the **Pacific Ocean** contributes the largest share of global stress scores.  

This analysis provides actionable insights for stakeholders, emphasizing risk mitigation, environmental stress monitoring, and regional interventions.

## üîç Data Analysis Workflow  

### Data Preprocessing  
- **Duplicates Removal**: Ensured data integrity by eliminating duplicate entries and also deleting columns which were not needed for analysis.  
- **Column Selection**: Retained only critical columns such as `Percent_Bleaching`, `Temperature_Kelvin`, `SSTA`, `Turbidity`, and `Windspeed`.  
- **New Measures**: Calculated metrics such as **Risk Index** (correlating stressors and severity) and **Average Environmental Stress Score**.

### Power BI Utilization  
- **Calculated Fields**: Derived measures like "Bleaching Severity Distribution" and "Seasonal Bleaching Trends".  
- **Visualization**: Created interactive charts, including heatmaps, pie charts, and distribution maps.

## üåü Key Insights  

### Global Bleaching Severity Distribution  
- **High Severity**: 2.44K coral regions affected.  
- **Medium Severity**: 4.82K coral regions affected.  
- **Low Severity**: 27.24K coral regions affected.  

### Regional Risk Trends  
- The **Indian Ocean** and **Pacific Ocean** exhibit the highest risk indices.  
- **The Bahamas** and **Belize** show urgent need for conservation.  

### Seasonal Bleaching Trends  
- Bleaching peaks during **April-May**, aligning with early summer temperature increases.

### Environmental Stress Factors  
- Average stress score: **306.38**.  
- Contributing factors: **Temperature Anomalies (SSTA)**, **Turbidity**, and **Windspeed**.

### Comparative Stress Scores by Oceans  
- **Indian Ocean**: **50.38%** of global stress scores.  
- **Pacific Ocean**: **38.78%**.

### Temporal Trends  
- **2019** recorded the highest bleaching events, correlating with rising global temperatures.

### Heatmap Analysis  
- **Milne Bay Region**, Papua New Guinea, shows persistently high temperatures, demanding urgent intervention.

## üí° Recommendations for Stakeholders  

### Strengthen Conservation Efforts in High-Risk Regions  
- Prioritize regions like the **Indian Ocean**, **Bahamas**, and **Belize** for reef restoration.  
- Localized conservation initiatives targeting high-stress areas.  

### Monitor and Mitigate Environmental Stressors  
- Deploy temperature and turbidity monitoring systems for real-time tracking.  
- Regulate coastal activities contributing to stress factors.  

### Seasonal Preparedness Programs  
- Implement seasonal interventions during peak bleaching months.  
- Educate communities on reducing stressors like pollution and overfishing.  

### Collaborate with International Organizations  
- Partner with global entities (e.g., **Coral Reef Alliance**, **UNESCO**) for resources and technical assistance.  

### Leverage Technology and AI for Monitoring  
- Use **AI-driven satellite imagery** to predict bleaching events.  
- Develop real-time dashboards for reporting and decision-making.  

### Public Awareness Campaigns  
- Create programs to raise awareness about coral bleaching and its effects.  
- Promote eco-friendly tourism and sustainable fishing practices.
